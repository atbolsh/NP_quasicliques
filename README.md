This is a sum of all code related to quasicliques, or orthonormal bases X that satisfy X^T M X = 0, where M is the error matrix.

I will be back, but it's clear that quasicliques are far more abundant (and higher dimensional) than cliques.

In the future, when I'm bored, I will likely use the kernel function for some sort of gradient descent, from a random 
quasiclique to one that is grid aligned, by a method with competing columns or something.
